StarCraft Steam Viewer

This project is a shameless rework of the chrome extension by Kyle Schouviller.
See: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/starcraft-2-stream-browse/lfkbpkejknkdjpnkpbjlhedmicnjmbka?hl=en
The original extension no longer works after twtiched updated the game category.
So I will be working and maintaining this new project that supports twitch, and maybe other streaming sites like YouTube Gaming as well.

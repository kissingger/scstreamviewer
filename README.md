#StarCraft Steam Viewer

This project is a shameless rework of the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/starcraft-2-stream-browse/lfkbpkejknkdjpnkpbjlhedmicnjmbka?hl=en) by Kyle Schouviller. The original extension no longer works after Twitch updated the game category. So I will be working and maintaining this new project that supports Twitch, and maybe other streaming sites like YouTube Gaming as well.
